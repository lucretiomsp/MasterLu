I am a **MicroDown Text Presenter** (`MicTextPresenter`) that displays useful lessons about **Sound Synthesis**.
These lessons serve as a compendium for `MasterLu` and to learn using **Phausto**, while also offering insights into sound synthesis in general.

The main inspiration for these leasons is the super cool [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7w4cOVVxL6HWGokiABmiZnssYQjo_UFd) by Professor [Simon Hutchinson](https://simonhutchinson.com/) 

To explore the lessons, just open a Playground and evaluate
```language=Pharo
SynthesisFundamentals new open.
```

Alternatiely, you can click on one of the executable examples available on the class side.

# Five Types of Synthesis

We can list a huge number of synthesis techniques, but we can break them into 5 macro-categories:

- **Subtractive Synthesis**
- **Additive Synthesis**
- **Modulation Synthesis / Distortion Synthesis**
- **Physical-Modeling Synthesis**
- **Sample-Based Synthesis / WaveTable synthesis**

## Subtractive Synthesis
A synthesis technique that involves the manipulation of specific frequencies through the use of filters (such as `ButterworthLPHP` , `MKOFilter` or `ResonatorFilter` subclasses), shaping the timbre of the sound by altering its harmonic content.

## Additive Synthesis
A synthesis technique that combines simple waveforms at varying frequencies, amplitudes, and phases to generate complex waveforms. [Hammond organs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hammond_organ) or [Thelharmoniums](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telharmonium) are simple examples of _Additive Synthesis_.

## Modulation Synthesis / Distortion Synthesis
A synthesis technique that alters the frequency or amplitude of a waveform using another waveform, creating complex timbres through techniques like FM ([Frequency Modulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_modulation_synthesis)) or AM ([Amplitude Modulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplitude_modulation)) synthesis.
In contrast, distortion synthesis shapes sound by intentionally clipping or transforming the waveform, adding harmonics and a harsher character, often used to produce rich, gritty tones.

## Physical-Modeling Synthesis
A synthesis technique n which the waveform is generated by computing a mathematical model that simulates the physical properties of a sound source, usually a musical instrument. By accurately modeling factors like resonance, material characteristics, and excitation methods, it can produce highly realistic and expressive sounds.  `ModalPercussion` , `StringInstruments` and `WindInstruments` subclasses are examples of _Physical-Modeling Synthesis_.

## Sample-Based Synthesis / WaveTable synthesis
A synthesis technique that generates sound by playing back pre-recorded audio samples, allowing for realistic reproduction of acoustic instruments and complex textures. In contrast, wavetable synthesis relies on cycling through pre-defined waveforms stored in tables, enabling efficient and versatile sound design by smoothly morphing between different waves. `TpSampler` is an example of _Sample-Based Synthesis_.

### Granular Synthesis
### Linear Arithmetic Synthesis
A synthesis technique invented by [Roland Corporation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roland_Corporation) that combines sample-based and subtractive synthesis with the sample sound providing the initial [transient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transient_(acoustics)) of the sound. `ModalPercussion` , `StringInstruments` and `WindInstruments` subclasses are examples of _Physical-Modeling Synthesis_.

# Five Types of Synthesis Modules

There are tons of synthesizers and software out there, but a really helpful way to approach them is by thinking about categories of modules.
We can break down any synthesizer into these 5 Synthesis Modules:
- **Generators**
- **Combiners**
- **Modifiers**
- **Time-Variant Controllers (TVCs)**
- **Storers (Storage)**

## Generators
**Generators** are sources of sound. They include `Oscillators`, `PhysicalModels` , `Noise` generators, and Samplers (such as `TpSampler`). In essence, they are components that produce audio signals.

## Combiners
**Combiners** are synthesis modules that combine audio from two ore more sources. _Mixers_ and _Crossfaders_ are example of **Combiners**. Most synthesizers use multiple *Generators** which  are then combined together to form the output.

## Modifiers
`Saturators` , _Filters_ (all the subclasses of `PhFilter`) , _Effects_ (such as `FlangerMono`, `CryBaby` or `AutoWah`) are all  **Modifiers**. These synthesis modules change the sound material sent into them.

## Time-Variant Controllers (TVCs)
These are synthesis s that generates a **control signal**. These are modules such as _Envelope Generators_(like `ADSREnv` or `AREnv`) _Low Frequency Oscillators_(`LFOForModulation`). They generate control signals that vary over time that can modulate parameters and reproduce _vibrato_ (a modulation of the pitch), _tremolo_(a modulation of the amplitude) or _timbre modulation_(which alter harmonic or spectral content).

## Storers (Storage)
A synthesis module that holds data (such as _wavetables_ , _soundfiles_ and so on)
